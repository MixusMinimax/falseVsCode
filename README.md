# false README

This is a language extension for the language "FALSE", more on the website [strlen.com/false-language](https://strlen.com/false-language/).

I have also written an interpreter and compiler in .NET, which can be found here: [github.com/MixusMinimax/falsedotnet](https://github.com/MixusMinimax/falsedotnet)

You can also use this extension in JetBrains Products: Go to `File>Settings>Editor>TextMate Bundles`. Then, click the `+` at the top and select the root folder of this repository (Which is probably located in your `~/.vscode/extensions` folder, no need to copy the repo) and hit Ok. Now you will have syntax highlighting for FALSE files in JetBrains Products, which is really useful if you're writing a compiler or interpreter, like me.

## Features
